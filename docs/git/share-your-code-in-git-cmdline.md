# Get started with Git from the command line

This guide show you how to share your code in a Team Services Git repo using the command line.  If you donâ€™t have a VSTS account, you can [sign up](../setup-admin/team-services/sign-up-for-visual-studio-team-services.md) for one for free. Each account includes free, unlimited private Git repositories.

The instructions below use the default bash shell used on Linux and Mac OS X, but the Git commands will work in any shell, including Git Bash from Git for Windows.

## Download and install Git

* [Windows](#windows)
* [macOS X](#macos-x)
* [Linux and Unix](#linux-and-unix)

### Windows

Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) , which includes the [Git Credential Manager](set-up-credential-managers.md) to 
easily connect to Team Services. 

### macOS X

Use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install and set up Git.

```
brew install git
```

### Linux and Unix

Use your distribution's package management system to download and install Git. For example, on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

Refer to the [list of install commands](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) for the most up to date instructions for your Linux distribution.

## Create your local repo

Create a local Git repo for your code. 

> If your code is already in a local Git repo, you can skip this step.

0. Navigate to the folder where your code is on the command line:

```
cd /home/fabrikam/fiber
```

0. Create a Git repo on your machine to store your code. You will connect this repo to Team Services in the next step.

```
git init .
```

0. Commit your code into the local Git repo.

```
git add --all
```

```
git commit -m "first commit of my code"
```

## Create your Team Services repo

0. [Create a new Team services Git repo](create-new-repo.md) for your code. Copy the clone URL once you are done creating your repo.

   ![Get the clone URL after creating the team services repo](_img/share-your-code-in-git-cmdline/clone_url.png)

0. Connect your local repo to the Team Services repo using the copied clone URL in the `git remote` command:

```
git remote add origin https://fabrikops2.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Fabrikam/_git/FabrikamApp
```


## Push your code 

> Set up authentication with [credential managers](set-up-credential-managers.md) or [SSH](use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate.md) before continuing.

```
git push origin master
```

## Next steps

Learn more about using Git in the [Git tutorial](tutorial/gitworkflow.md) and [create a build](../build-release/overview.md) for your project code.
