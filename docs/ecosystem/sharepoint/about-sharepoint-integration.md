# About SharePoint Integration  

**TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013**  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> TFS 2017 and later versions no longer support native integration with Office Project Server. If you're working with an on-premises TFS 2015 or TFS 2013, see [Synchronize TFS with Project Server](/vsts/work/tfs-ps-sync/synchronize-tfs-project-server?toc=/vsts/ecosystem/sharepoint/toc.json&bc=/vsts/ecosystem/sharepoint/breadcrumb/toc.json).


## Built-in features replacing the TFS-SharePoint integration 

One of the main reasons to work with a SharePoint portal is to share informtion with your teams. You can still use a SharePoint portal to share information with your team, it's just that some TFS-SharePoint integration features will no longer work. This is described in XXX. 

When you [upgrade to TFS 2018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=856344), you can access the following features which removes the reliance on some of the integration features: 

- [Multiple, configurable team dashboards](../../report/dashboards.md) 
- [Team project wiki](../../collaborate/add-edit-wiki.md)

## TFS Disconnector for SharePoint and TFS/SharePoint deprecation

## TFS Extension for SharePoint products   

For TFS 2015 and TFS 2013, to work with a SharePoint portal and SharePoint artifacts, you must install the TFS Extension for SharePoint on a SharePoint 2010 or 2013 server. The extension installs the following artifacts used by TFS SharePoint sites:
* TFS site templates
* TFS features
* TFS web parts

The extension provides an integration between TFS and SharePoint to support the following:
* SharePoint dashboards
* Excel reports (typically hosted in the SharePoint portal)
* Document library 
* SharePoint wiki

## Ways teams share information using the SharePoint portal  
 Your team can use the SharePoint portal to share information in the following ways:  
  
-   **Share data contained in reports or dashboards**   
     The reports and dashboards that you'll have access to depend on the process template created with your team project.   
  
-   **Share team progress using predefined or customized dashboards**   
     Dashboards provide information necessary to quickly understand the status of a team project. Because the project portal is composed of Web parts, you can create a customized version of it. Besides the standard information displayed on the project portal, you can add Web parts that connect to other data sources inside and outside the project. For more information about customizing the page layout or adding Web parts, choose  **Help** on the project portal menu bar.  
  
-   **Share documents, files, images**    
     Teams can [upload and organize documents into folders and subfolders](../../report/sharepoint-dashboards/manage-documents-and-document-libraries.md).  
  
-   **Share team knowledge and processes using the SharePoint wiki**   
     See [Manage a wiki](https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Manage-a-wiki-D200A755-3AD5-4EF6-8CDC-B149770E237F).  
  
-   **Reference process guidance for select team project artifacts**   
     Process guidance provides information about how to coordinate work on a team project and how to use a type of work item in the overall project life cycle.
