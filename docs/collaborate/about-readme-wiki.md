# About READMEs and Wiki

**Team Services | TFS 2017**



## READMEs

READMes are files written in Markdown format that provide ... 

You can define a README file, or multiple files, for each repo or team project. 


Write your readme in [Markdown](../reference/markdown-guidance.md) instead of plain text. Markdown makes it easy to format text, include images, and link as needed to additional documentation from your readme.

Here are some great readmes that use this format and speak to all three audiences, for reference and inspiration:

- [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/Home)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
- [Chakra Core](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore)
