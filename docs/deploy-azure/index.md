# Deploy to Azure

Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) is Microsoft's DevOps solution for Azure. Whether you are developing a .NET, Java, Node, PHP, or a Python app, or whether you are targeting app services, virtual machines, or containers in Azure, VSTS helps you set up a highly customizable continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline. Tutorials, references, and other documentation show you how to configure and manage CI/CD for the app of your choice to Azure services.

## 5-Minute Quickstarts

Learn how to build your app and deploy it to your choice of Azure service.
