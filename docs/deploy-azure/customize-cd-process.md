# Customize your continuous deployment (CD) process

Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) provides a highly customizable continuous deployment service for managing the release
of your applications. Your release definition is where you specify how your deployments work and who approves them. You can also initiate and track releases from here.

In this tutorial, you learn about:

> * Release definitions in VSTS
> * Extending a release definition by adding environments
> * Adding approvals within a release definition
> * Creating a release
> * Monitoring and tracking deployments

## Prerequisites

You need to have worked through the quickstart [Deploy your ASP.NET Core app to an Azure web app](aspnet-core-to-azure-webapp.md)
before you start this tutorial. That quickstart creates an Azure App Services website, and generates a build and release definition
that you will use in this tutorial. However, you can start with any other release definition, perhaps created by one of the other
quickstarts or tutorials, but you will then need to adapt the following steps to match your own release definition. 

You will also need an additional Azure App Services website to deploy your app to when you add a new environment to the release
definition in this tutorial. It's a good idea to create that now by following
[these steps in the quickstart](aspnet-core-to-azure-webapp.md#create-webapp-portal). You'll need to choose
a different name for your new website, perhaps containing the text "QA" to help you easily see which is which later on.

## Release definitions in VSTS

In this section, you will explore the release definition that was created by the [Deploy your ASP.NET Core app to an Azure web app](aspnet-core-to-azure-webapp.md) quickstart.

1. In VSTS, open the **Releases** page in the **Build &amp; Release** hub. Select your release definition in the left pane
   and choose **Edit** in the main section of the page.

   ![Opening the release definition for editing](_img/customize-cd-process/open-release-definition.png)

   Notice that the page shows the release generated by the previous quickstart succeeded. 

   [What's the difference between a release definition and a release?](../build-release/concepts/releases/index.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json)

1. The release definition opens on the **Pipeline** page, which shows the artifacts and the environments in the definition.
   The **Build** item lists the artifacts for the definition; in this case just the artifact named **drop**. Choose this
   to open the **Artifact** panel that shows more details of the artifact. 

   ![Viewing the pipeline and artifacts details](_img/customize-cd-process/default-pipeline.png)

   You can add more artifacts to a definition by choosing the **+ Add** link in the **Artifacts** section.
   For more information, see [Artifacts](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/artifacts.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json)
   in the Release Management documentation.

1. Choose the **Continuous deployment trigger** icon in the **Artifacts** section to open the trigger panel.
   You can see that it was set when the release definition was generated by the Azure Continuous Delivery feature
   in the previous quickstart, so that deployment is started after the build is completed.

   ![Viewing the continuous integration trigger setting](_img/customize-cd-process/ci-trigger.png)

   For more information, see [Release triggers](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/triggers.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json)
   in the Release Management documentation.

1. Choose the **Pre-deployment conditions** icon in the **Environments** section to open the conditions panel.
   You can see that the Azure Continuous Delivery feature set the trigger for deployment to this environment as
   **Release**. This means that a deployment will be initiated automatically when a new release is created from
   this release definition.   

   ![Viewing the environment trigger setting](_img/customize-cd-process/environment-trigger.png)

   Notice that you can also set up a schedule for deployments; for example, if you want to deploy at a specific time of day
   when you know the app will not be heavily used. For more information, see [Environment triggers](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/triggers.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json)
   in the Release Management documentation.

1. Choose the **Tasks** tab to open the page that defines the deployment process for your environment.
   Select the **Phase1** item in the left pane to display details of the process phase that will deploy the app.
   The Azure Continuous Delivery feature selected the **Hosted 2017** queue containing the agent that will
   execute the deployment to the target website. This queue is hosted in Azure (so you don't need to set up
   any additional servers), and is specially designed to deploy ASP.NET Core apps.  

   ![Viewing the default process and task settings](_img/customize-cd-process/default-task-phase.png)

   For more information, see [Build and release agents](../build-release/concepts/agents/agents.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json)
   in the Release Management documentation.

1. Select the **Deploy Azure App Service** task in the left pane. This shows the settings for the task that will
   execute the deployment.

   ![Viewing the deployment task settings](_img/customize-cd-process/deploy-task-settings.png)

   Notice that the Azure Continuous Delivery feature set the subscription and App Service name
   when it created the definition. It also specified the location of the packaged website artifacts (a zip file) using
   the pre-defined variable named **System.DefaultWorkingDirectory**. In addition, because this is an ASP.NET Core app,
   it set the **Take App Offline** option to stop the website before deploying a new set of artifacts, and restart it afterwards
   (this is not required for ASP.NET and most other types of app, which allow the web pages to be overwritten while the site is running).

   For more information, see [Tasks for Build and Release](../build-release/concepts/process/tasks.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json)
   and [Variables in Release Management](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/variables.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json).

## Extend a release definition by adding environments

In this section, you will add a new environment to the release definition. This environment will deploy your app to the new 
Azure App Services website. This is a typical scenario where you deploy initially to a test or staging server, and then to a
live or production server. Each [environment](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/environments.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json)
represents one deployment target, though that target could be a physical or virtual server,
a groups of servers, or any other legitimate physical or virtual deployment target.

1. Open the **Pipeline** tab of the release definition and select the existing **Production** environment.
   Then open the **+ Add** drop-down list and choose **Clone environment** (the clone option is available only
   when an existing environment is selected).

   ![Cloning the existing environment](_img/customize-cd-process/clone-environment.png)

   Typically, you want to use exactly the same deployment methods with a test and a production environment
   so that you can be sure the deployed apps will behave in exactly the same way. Therefore, cloning an existing
   environment is a good way to ensure you have the same settings for both. Then you just need to change the deployment
   targets (the websites where each copy of the app will be deployed).

1. The clone of the environment appears after the existing environment in the pipeline, and has the name **Copy of Production**.
   Select this environment and, in the **Environment** panel, change the name to **QA**. 

   ![Renaming the clone environment](_img/customize-cd-process/rename-copy-environment.png)

1. To reorganize the environments in the pipeline, choose the **Pre-deployment conditions** icon for the **QA** environment and
   set the trigger to **After release**. The pipeline diagram changes to show that the deployment to the two environments will
   now execute in parallel. 

   ![Changing the QA environment trigger](_img/customize-cd-process/change-trigger-qa.png)

1. Choose the **Pre-deployment conditions** icon for the **Production** environment and
   set the trigger to **After environment**, then select **QA** in the **Environments** drop-down list.
   The pipeline diagram changes to show that the deployment to the two environments will
   now execute in the required order.
     
   ![Changing the Production environment trigger](_img/customize-cd-process/change-trigger-prod.png)
 
   Notice that you can specify deployment to start when a deployment to the previous environment is _partially_ successful.
   Usually, this means the deployment tasks were set to continue the deployment even if a specific non-critical task failed
   (the default is that all tasks must succeed). You're most likely to set this option if you create a pipeline containing
   [fork and join deployments](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/triggers.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json)
   that deploy to different environments in parallel.  

1. Open the **Tasks** drop-down list and choose the **QA** environment.

   ![Open the tasks pane for the QA environment](_img/customize-cd-process/open-qa-tasks.png)

1. Recall that this environment is a clone of the original **Production** environment that was created by the Azure Continuous Delivery
   feature you used in the previous quickstart. Therefore, currently, it will deploy the app to the same website. To change this,
   select the **Deploy Azure App Service** task and then select the new "QA" website you created at the start of this tutorial.

   ![Change the deployment target the QA environment](_img/customize-cd-process/change-target-environment.png)

## Add approvals within a release definition

The release definition you have modified deploys to test and then to production. If the deployment to test fails, the trigger 
on the production environment does not fire, and so it is not deployed to production. However, it is typically the case that
you want the deployment to pause after _successful_ deployment to the test website so that you can verify the app is working correctly before
you deploy to production. In this section, you will add an approval step to the release definition to achieve this.

1. Back in the **Pipeline** tab of the release definition, choose the **Pre-deployment conditions** icon in the **Environments** section
   to open the conditions panel. Scroll down to the **Pre-deployment approvers** section and expand it using the "down arrow" icon.
   You can see that the approval type is set to **Automatic**, which means that deployment to this environment, when initiated by any
   of the environment triggers, will be approved without user intervention - and deployment will commence immediately.  

   ![Viewing the pre-deployment approvers settings](_img/customize-cd-process/open-approvers.png)

1. Change the approval type to **Specific users** and choose your account from the list. You
   can type part of a name to search for matches.

   ![Selecting the pre-deployment approvers](_img/customize-cd-process/select-approvers.png)

   You can add as many approvers as you need, both individual accounts and account groups.
   It's also possible to set up post-deployment approvals by choosing the icon at the right side of the environment item in the pipeline diagram. 
   For more information, see [Environments in Release Management](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/environments.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json).

1. Save the modified release definition.

   ![Save the release definition](_img/customize-cd-process/save-definition.png)

## Create a release

Now that you have completed the modifications to the release definition, it's time to start the deployment. To do this, you
create a release from the release definition. A release may be created automatically; for example, the continuous deployment
trigger was set in the release definition when it was originally generated in the previous quickstart. This means that modifying
the source code will start a new build and, from that, a new release. However, in this section you will create a new release manually.

1. Open the **Release** drop-down list and choose **Create release**.

   ![Creating a new release](_img/customize-cd-process/create-release.png)

1. Enter a description for the release, and check that the artifact named **Drop** is selected. Then choose **Queue**.

   ![Queuing the new release](_img/customize-cd-process/queue-release.png)

1. After a few moments, a banner appears indicating that the new release was created.
   Choose the link (the name of the release).

   ![The link to the newly created release](_img/customize-cd-process/release-link.png)

1. The release summary page opens showing details of the release. In the **Environments** section
   you will see the deployment status for the **QA** environment change from "IN PROGRESS" to "SUCCEEDED" and, at that point,
   a banner appears indicating that the release is now waiting for approval.
   When a deployment to an environment is pending or has failed, a blue (i) information icon is shown.
   Point to this to see a pop-up containing the reason.

   ![Release summary showing link for approval](_img/customize-cd-process/approval-waiting.png)

   Other views, such as the list of releases, also display an icon that indicates approval is pending.
   The icon shows a pop-up containing the environment name and more details when you point to it.
   This makes it easy for an administrator to see which releases are awaiting approval, as well as the overall progress of all releases.    

   ![Release list showing link for approval](_img/customize-cd-process/list-approval-waiting.png)

1. Choose the **Approve or Reject** link to open the approval dialog. Enter a brief note about the
   approval, and choose **Approve**. 

   ![Approving the release](_img/customize-cd-process/approve-dialog.png)

   Notice that you can defer a deployment to a specific day and time; for example, a time when you expect the app to be only lightly loaded.
   You can also reassign the approval to another user. Release administrators can open _any_ approval
   and over-ride it to accept or reject that deployment.

## Monitor and track deployments

In this section, you will see how you can monitor and track the deployment to the two Azure App Services websites 
from the release you created in the previous section.

1. In the release summary page, choose the **Logs** link. While the deployment is taking place,
   this page shows the live log from the agent and, in the left pane, an indication of the status
   of each operation in the deployment process for each environment.

   ![Viewing the live deployment log](_img/customize-cd-process/live-logs-deployment.png)

1. After the deployment is complete, the entire log file is displayed in the right pane.
   Select any of the process steps in the left pane to show just the log file contents for that step.
   This makes it easier to trace and debug individual parts of the overall deployment. Alternatively, download
   the individual log files, or a zip of all the log files, from the icons and links in the page.

   ![Viewing and downloading individual log files](_img/customize-cd-process/download-logs.png)

1. Open the **Summary** tab to see the overall detail of the release. It shows details of the build and
   the environments it was deployed to - along with the deployment status and other information about
   the release.   

   ![Viewing the summary page](_img/customize-cd-process/final-summary.png)

1. Select each of the environment links to see more details about
   existing and pending deployments to that specific environment.
   You can use these pages to verify that the same build was deployed to both environments.

   ![Viewing details from one environment](_img/customize-cd-process/environment-result-details.png)

1. Open the deployed production app in your browser from the URL `http://[your-app-name].azurewebsites.net`

   ![Viewing the deployed app in the production environment](_img/customize-cd-process/finished-app.png)

If you are having problems with a deployment, you can get more information from the log files by
running the release in debug mode. For more information, see
[How To: Monitor releases and debug deployment issues](../build-release/actions/debug-deployment-issues.md?toc=/vsts/deploy-azure/toc.json).
