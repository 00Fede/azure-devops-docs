# Integrate Visual Studio Team Services with other applications

Service hooks enable you to perform tasks on other services when events happen in your Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) projects. For example, create a card in Trello when a work item is created or send a push notification to your team's mobile devices when a build fails. Service hooks can also be used in custom apps and services as a more efficient way to drive activities when events happen in your projects.
