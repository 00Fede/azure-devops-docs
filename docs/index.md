# User guide to getting started 

<b>Team Services | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013</b> 

**!!! PLACEHOLDER CONTENT - TO BE REDONE AS YML  !!!** 

New to Team Services or TFS? Want to get up and running quickly? Feeling a bit overwhelmed? 

Start here to get a basic-level understanding of how to sign-up, create a repo to support source control, start planning and tracking your work, and more.   

If you're new to Team Services or TFS, you can get familiar with our cloud and on-premises client-server offerings from these overview topics.

## 5-minute quickstarts  

Start by signing up for a Team Services account or logging into an existing account. To get started with an on-premises TFS, see [Install TFS](setup-admin/tfs/install/single-server.md). 

Once you have a team project defined or have been added as a team member, you can start coding or tracking work collaboratively.
