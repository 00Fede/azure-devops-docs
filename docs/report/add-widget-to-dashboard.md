# Add widgets to a dashboard

<b>Team Services | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015.1-2015.3</b>  


Widgets smartly format data to provide access to easily consumable data. You add widgets to your team dashboards to gain visibility into the status and trends occurring as you develop your software project. 

Each widget provides access to a chart, user-configurable information, or a set of links that open a feature or function. 

You can add one or more charts or widgets to your dashboard. You add several widgets at a time simply by selecting each one. See [Dashboards, Manage dashboards](dashboards.md#manage) to determine the permissions you need to add and remove widgets from a dashboard.    

>[!IMPORTANT]  
><b>Feature availability: </b> You can access the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) from the web portal for Team Services or TFS 2015.1 or later version. The widget catalog provides widgets for all tiles supported in previous releases of TFS for the team homepage. For on-premises TFS 2015, you can add select charts to the team home page using the [Pin to home page](team-dashboard.md) feature.

>To determine the platform and version you're on, see [Provide product and content feedback, Platforms and version support](../provide-feedback.md#platform-version).   



## Add a widget to a dashboard  

For Team Services and TFS 2015.1 and later versions, you can add a widget to a dashboard. 
 
>[!NOTE]  
>Widget images may vary depending on which platform you access. This topic shows images that appear in Team Services. However, the widget title and functionality described in this topic are valid for both Team Services and TFS. For example, dashboard edit mode controls shown below are valid for Team Services and TFS 2015.2 and later version. Some functionality differs when you connect to TFS 2015.1 or earlier versions.  
 
Click ![Edit dashboard icon](_img/edit-dashboard-icon.png) to modify a dashboard. Click ![add a widget icon](_img/add-widget-icon.png) to add a widget to the dashboard.  

The [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) describes all the available widgets, many of which are scoped to the selected team context.  

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b>For Team Services and TFS 2017 and later versions, you can drag and drop a widget from the catalog onto the dashboard.    


## Configure a widget  

To configure a widget, add the widget to a dashboard and then click the ![configure icon](_img/icons/configure-icon.png) configure icon. 

![Work item chart unconfigured widget](_img/add-widget-configure-initial.png)  

Click the delete icon to remove the tile from the dashboard. 
 
Once you've configured the widget, you can edit it by opening the actions menu.
