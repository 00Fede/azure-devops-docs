## Create an Azure web app to host a container

1. Sign into your Azure Account at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the Azure Portal, choose **New**, **Web + Mobile**, then choose **Web App for Containers**.    

1. Enter a name for your new web app, and select or create a new Resource Group.
   Then choose **Configure container** and select **Azure Container Registry**.
   Use the drop-down lists to select the registry you created earlier, and the
   Docker image and tag that was generated by the build definition.

   The **Docker** tasks you used in the build definition when you created the
   build artifacts push the Docker image back into your Azure Container Registry.
   The web app you created here will host an instance of that image and expose it as a website.

1. Wait until the new web app has been created.
