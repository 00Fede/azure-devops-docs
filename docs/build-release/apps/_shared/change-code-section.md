## Change the code and watch a new version automatically deploy

Now that you have a completely automated CI/CD pipeline, any changes that you make to the application are automatically built and deployed by VSTS. To try this, make a change to the app and commit that change to the Git repository.

You can use Visual Studio to connect and push commits into your VSTS Git repo. (See [Share code with push](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/git/tutorial/pushing).) However, VSTS also features a web-based editor to so that you can quickly commit small changes to source code directly in your browser.
