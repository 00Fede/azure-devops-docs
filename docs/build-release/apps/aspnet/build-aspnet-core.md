# Build your ASP.NET Core app

**VSTS | TFS 2017 Update 2**

[ASP.NET Core](http://www.asp.net/core) is a lean and composable framework for building web and cloud applications. Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) provide a highly customizable continuous integration (CI) process to automatically build your ASP.NET Core app whenever your team pushes or checks in code. In this tutorial you learn how to define your CI process.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-cd-prerequisites-vsts.md)]

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-cd-prerequisites-tfs.md)]

## Import sample app code

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/import-code-aspnet-core.md)]

## Set up continuous integration

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-quickstart-intro.md)]

[//]: # (TODO: Restore use of includes when we get support for using them in a list.)

[//]: # (TODO: [!INCLUDE [include](_shared/create-aspnet-core-build-team-services.md)

[//]: # (TODO: [!INCLUDE [include](_shared/aspnet-core-build-tasks.md)

1. On the **Files** tab of the **Code** hub, click **Set up build**.

 You are taken to the **Build & Release** hub and asked to **Choose a template**.

1. In the right panel, click **ASP.NET Core**, and then click **Apply**.

 You now see all the tasks that were automatically added to the build definition by the template. These are the steps that will automatically run every time check in code.

1. For the **Default agent queue**:

 * **VSTS:** Select _Hosted VS2017_. This is how you can use our pool of agents that have the software you need to build a .NET Core app.

 * **TFS:** Select a queue that includes a [Windows build agent](../../actions/agents/v2-windows.md).

1. Click the **Triggers** tab in the build definition. Enable the **Continuous Integration** trigger. This will ensure that the build process is automatically triggered every time you commit a change to your repository.

1. Click **Save and queue** to kick off your first build. On the **Queue build** dialog box, click **Queue**.

1. A new build is started. You'll see a link to the new build on the top of the page. Click the link to watch the new build as it happens.
