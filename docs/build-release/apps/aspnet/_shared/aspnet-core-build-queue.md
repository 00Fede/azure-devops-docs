 > In general your build will run faster with private agents, especially if you don't clean the repository.

### Visual Studio 2017

For the **default agent queue**, select **Hosted VS2017**. If you're using TFS or VSTS with private agents, select the queue connected with a pool that has agents with Visual Studio 2017 installed.

### Visual Studio 2015

For the **default agent queue**, select **Hosted**. If you're using TFS or VSTS with private agents, select the queue connected with a pool that has agents with Visual Studio 2015 installed.
