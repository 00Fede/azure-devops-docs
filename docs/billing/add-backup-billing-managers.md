#  Add backup billing managers for your Team Services account

**Team Services**



To let others manage billing or make purchases through Visual Studio Marketplace for your Team Services account, 
add **owner** or **contributor** roles to users in the Azure subscription that's linked to your Team Services account.

For for information on billing, see [billing concepts](billing-concepts.md)


[Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the Azure subscription administrator, and navigate to access control to add owners or contributors:

Owners and contributors of the Azure subscription linked to your Team Services account can make purchases in the 
Marketplace.  Owners can also add these roles to other users.
