- Guide to usage, when to use (table)  
- Finding, listing - adhoc search versus query

- Charts 
- Work item templates 


## Define work items  

 


## Try this next  

Take these tools for a test run by [creating an account on Team Services for free](../../setup-admin/team-services/sign-up-for-visual-studio-team-services.md). From there, you're ready to [create your backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md).  

Once you've started tracking work, you'll want to monitor and track progress, identify trends, and share your plans. See [Charts, dashboards, and widgets](../../report/overview.md).
