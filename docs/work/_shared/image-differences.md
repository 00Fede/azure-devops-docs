>The images you see from your web portal may differ from the images you see in this topic. These differences result from updates made to VSTSor your on-premises TFS, [options that you or your admin have enabled](/vsts/collaborate/preview-features), and which process was chosen when creating your team project&mdash;[Agile](/vsts/work/guidance/agile-process), [Scrum](/vsts/work/guidance/scrum-process), or [CMMI](/vsts/work/guidance/cmmi-process). However, the basic functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned.
