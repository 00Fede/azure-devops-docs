# About Kanban and project management 
 
Kanban uses a visual interactive board to plan and show progress using cards. Your Kanban board is fully customizable to support the workflow used by your team.  

[![Configure Kanban board](../_img/gs-planning-configure-kanban.png)](kanban-basics.md)[![Update the Kanban board](../_img/gs-planning-track-kanban.png)](kanban-basics.md)[![Monitor progress](../_img/gs-planning-monitor-kanban.png)](../../report/guidance/cumulative-flow.md)

You update the status of work by dragging card to another column on the Kanban board. You can even change the order of items as you move a card to a new column.

## Try this next  

Take these tools for a test run by [creating an account on Team Services for free](../../setup-admin/team-services/sign-up-for-visual-studio-team-services.md). From there, you're ready to [create your backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md).  

Once you've started tracking work, you'll want to monitor and track progress, identify trends, and share your plans. See [Charts, dashboards, and widgets](../../report/overview.md).
