# Kanban

<b>Team Services | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013</b> 

Your Kanban board turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of work. As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. Each column represents a work stage, and each card represents a backlog item, user story, or bug at that stage of work.

## 5-minute Quickstarts  

Start tracking work by adding work items, updating status, and inviting others to use your Kanban board.
