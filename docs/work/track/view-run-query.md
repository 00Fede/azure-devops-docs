# View or run a query   

<b>VSTS</b> 

To find work items assigned to you or your team, run one or more queries.  

## Open the Queries page from the web portal

0. From your web browser, open your product backlog from the **Work** hub, **Queries** page. If you don't have a team project yet, create one in [VSTS](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md).   
 
	<img src="_img/view-run-queries/open-hub-page.png" alt="Web portal, choose Work hub, Queries" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" /> 

0. If you see the following message, click **Try it!** to enable the new queries experience.

### Quick tips on shared queries

If you are new to VSTS and TFS and shared queries, review these tips to learn how you can manage work more effectively:

-   To find work items that are assigned to you, add **@Me** as the value for the Assigned To field in one of the query clauses.  
-   All valid users with standard access can create queries and folders under the **My Queries** area. To create queries and query folders under **Shared Queries**, you must have the Contribute permission set. For more information, see [Set permissions on queries](../track/set-query-permissions.md).
-   You can modify any query by adding criteria to focus on a product area, an iteration, or another field. To modify a query, [open the query editor](../track/using-queries.md).   
-   You can open any query in [Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Project](../backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md), where you can update the fields of one or more work items and publish your changes to the database for tracking work items.  
-   You can [visualize status or progress](../../report/charts.md) by creating a pie-chart, column chart, or trend chart for flat-list queries.
