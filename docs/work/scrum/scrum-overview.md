# About Scrum and project management 

The Scrum method uses sprints to plan work to perform by a team within a specific time period and cadence. To get started, several sprints are predefined for your team.  If you're new to Scrum, get an overview from [What is Scrum?](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-scrum/). 

[![Schedule sprints](../_img/gs-planning-define-sprints.png)](define-sprints.md)[![Plan a sprint](../_img/gs-planning-plan-sprint.png)](sprint-planning.md)[![Monitor sprint progress](../_img/gs-planning-monitor-sprint.png)](task-board.md)[![Forecast](../_img/gs-planning-forecast.png)](forecast.md)

You can quickly assign work items to a sprint by dragging and dropping them from the product backlog to the sprint.

## Try this next  

Take these tools for a test run by [creating an account on VSTS for free](../../accounts/create-account-with-personal-msa.md). From there, you're ready to [create your backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md).  

Once you've started tracking work, you'll want to monitor and track progress, identify trends, and share your plans. See [Charts, dashboards, and widgets](../../report/overview.md). 


## Related notes

You access tools provided by VSTS and TFS by connecting from a client to the server, either in the cloud or on-premises. Some web portal tools require additional Visual Studio Subscriptions or Advanced/VS Enterprise access. To learn more, see [Permissions and access for work tracking](../permissions-access-work-tracking.md). 



For an overview of all your customization options, see [Customize your work tracking experience](../customize/customize-work.md).
